# < IP converter >

## Description 

**‘Ip converter’** is an application made in C language that allows the user to convert an IP address in decimal form to binary and vice versa.<br>
The program accepts only an IP in a specified format which is xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx containing numbers from 0 to 255 while in decimal and xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx allowing 0 and 1 only while in binary format.<br>
It is an academic project made for educational purposes , aiming to be a very useful and easy tool both for students and network professionals.<br> 
Also as the code is freely distributable we hope that it will be a good learning experience for beginners or anyone wishing to have a taste of programming on a basic level.<br>

## Instalation

In order to use our code, someone would need a compiler programm for C language. Few examples are [Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/),[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), or can use and online compiler (e.x https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/). 
After having a compiler, next step would be to copy the code and paste it into your compiler.

## Usage

The use of the code is quite easy to follow. There are three options for this project for the user to decide.

+ As you can see, _Option 1_ requires from the user,
firstly to press #1 in order to start that option. After pressing #1 and enter, it will be required to insert a 32 bit binary IP address in order to covert it into decimal form,as displayed in the image bellow.

+ The user can insert a binary number as an IP address (we choose a random binary number for the display). The result will be an IP address in decimal form, and the programm will get back to the menu in order to choose another option.

+ Moving on, we can choose _Option 2_ so we can convert the IP address the other way around,meaning from decimal form to binary.As the user chooses _Option 2_ it will be asked from him to enter an IP address in decimal form.The user can insert an IP address in order to convert it into a binary form and back to the menu in order to choose _Option 3_ to terminate the programm.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.

## Tests


In order to verify the functionality of the application, we used the following scenarios, resulting in a successful pass for all.

+ Case 1 – IP conversion - The user inputs an IP address following the specified format,
expected behavior is to return an IP from the opposite form and show the expected text:

<ul>
<li>IP1: 192.168.3.1</li> <li>IP2: 10.24.20.20</li> <li>IP3: 0.0.0.0</li>

<li>IP4: 10111100 11101100 00001111 00000001</li>
      
![test3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116667541/216768727-934d5d8a-7159-4d41-ae0a-e9501c81fc20.png)
      
<li>IP5:00001111 10101010 01010101 11111111</li>
      
![test2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116667541/216768471-348a66c1-0797-4275-9055-9bb16ee069e8.png)
      
<li>a)    Decimal to Binary -   Result = All Pass</li>
<li>b)    Binary to Decimal –    Result = All Pass</li>
</ul>      

+ Case 2 – Menu – The user chooses a menu from the specified options and an invalid option which is a number , a symbol and an alphabet as well as combinations of all.
Expected behavior is to show text:<br>
A) “Enter 32-bit IP address in dotted decimal notation(...):” if input is 1 – Result = Pass<br>
B) “Enter 32-bit Ip address in binary form (xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx): "if input is 2 – Result = Pass<br>
C) "I don't know the option “if input is anything else Result = Fail – the choice number was shown incorrectly (Changed the code to show “I don’t know this option “instead.<br>
D) ”Quit the program: if option 3 and close the application– Result = Pass<br>

+ Case 3 – Invalid user inputs after the initial menu choice – Expected Behavior is to show the correct error messages
A)    Option 2 – Decimal to Binary – 
i)The user inputs an invalid number, alphabet or symbol – Result = Fail (No error message, no escape sequence, program crashed)
ii)The user inputs a number in invalid size (too short, too long) – Result = Pass
      B)Option 2 – Binary to Decimal –
I)The user inputs a number that is not 1 or 2 ,and also an alphabet or symbol – Result = Pass
ii)The user input a binary number of invalid size – Result = Fail (A 9 digit number was accepted and result was returned)
