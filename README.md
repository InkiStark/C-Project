## Instalation

Few examples are [Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/),[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), or can use and online compiler (e.x https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/). 
After having a compiler, next step would be to copy the code and paste it into your compiler.
